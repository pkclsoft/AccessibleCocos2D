This repository contains a cocos2d-iphone v2.1 project with additional code that can be used to glue Cocos2d CCNode objects to the UIKit accessibility API.

v1.3

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just open the project in Xcode and run the sample which provides a very simple demonstration of how to make menu buttons accessible.
* Configuration - to see it working, ensure either Voiceover or Switch Control is enabled on your device.  The simulator may also be used if you enable the accessibility inspector within the simulator.
* Dependencies - I've provided a complete clone of Cocos2d v2.1 with some of my favourite patches (gesture recognisers, etc), so everything required should be present.
